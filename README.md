Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass team provided DMV practice test preparation, road lessons, and other services to help students pass their road test. What they required of their system was the ability to sell their driving and lesson packages, connect students with drivers, manage customer accounts, and gather feedback.

What did you do particularly well?
In this project I translated the clients business requirements into a Business Requirements Document (BRD) and UML diagrams that captured the systems functional, structural, and behavioral components.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
As the BRD is an integral and foundational component of the system design process, I would choose to revise the document so that I could better capture the customer's requirements in a more concise and clear manner. I would improve it by revisiting the structure of the document and ensuring that I fully captured the client's needs and organized them appropriately.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by carefully examining an interview transcript between the team and extracting the relevant details of the conversation. When designing a system it is important to consider the user's needs so that they are at the forefront of the design process. By understanding the needs of the user early a system designer is better able to specify and design a system that meets those needs and captures them in the relevant design documents without too much need for revision. This leads to a system that is more feature complete and delivered on time.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software it is important to consider the software/system development life cycle, taking a methodical approach that starts by considering the needs of the client and building upon those needs in the design process. The final deliverable (the software) should be implemented at the end of the design process once an agreed upon system design is arrived upon. In the future I will be careful to consider the needs of the client and employ strong communication skills to help them fully explore all possibilities.
